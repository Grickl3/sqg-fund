# Slow Spread Sink  

TLDR: This whole repository is essentially a prototype. In the near future there will be a separate repo which will be a React based application. That will be the production build. This repo will persist. It will contain all of the design specs and conceptual documentation. Why? Well, okay, don't tell anybody, but Deacon isn't really a full-stack web-developer. Actually, Deacon's title in the business is Design Strategist, so writing the really good code isn't really his job. Speaking in the third person and specifying the hell out of some projects. That's Deacon's job. That, and writing in the third person.
