I'm doing a thing. It's a kinda crazy thing.


And, absolutely no one is surprised that I would be doing something a little nuts.

So, I started a crowd funding campaign -> here. The campaign is simple enough, but I'm going about it â€¦ well, you'll see. After you check it out, though, please tell me what you think. This is a small part of a big ongoing conversation that is happening everywhere about the resource access, the means of production, and the systems we rely on to organize the capital we need generate movement. 

Let me know what you think and whether or not you'd be interested in hearing more about this. Email, call, or text. I'm not going to send out daily or even weekly emails, but I would like to know who is interested in talking more about this project and the related economics as it progresses.

Thank you, I hope to talk to you soon,
