There are three distinct and highly interrelated outcomes that this campaign is going for:

- Create a crowdfunding option based in flexibility.

 	Make it free from any irrelevant political or prescriptive excess, one which allows campaign designers to organize dynamic combinations of community resources including money, time, materials, and ideas. And, just make it free.

- Make some good art for the people who support me.

	I am really enjoying the idea of a super simple first campaign using this system, a campaign that is just about what the project is about â€” people being inspired to make and share meaning and inspiration.

- Grow this little seed of inspirational mementos into something I haven't fully imagined yet.

	Along the way, I'll also be setting up a little permanent site to continue this theme. It won't just be a webstore. Throughout the course of this campaign, with guidance from all of you, I hope to design something elegant and substantial that lives in one little corner of the internet and helps people in a rough patch like the one I'm just coming out of to find their way ahead.
